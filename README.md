# LAB 2(https://github.com/Zaidis/MAGD-150/blob/gh-pages/f18magd150lab02_Weber.zip)
  This lab challenged us to create a project with an outerspace theme. I was to work with colors, such as RGB, and HSB. 
# LAB 3(https://github.com/Zaidis/MAGD-150/blob/gh-pages/f18_magd150_lab03_Weber.zip)
  This lab challenged us to create a project that uses math as well as mouse interaction.
# Lab 4(https://github.com/Zaidis/MAGD-150/blob/gh-pages/f18magd150lab04_Weber.zip)
  This lab challenged us to create a project that uses key interaction and mouse interaction. As well as changing the position of                    certain objects, in this case the boat. 
# Lab 5(https://github.com/Zaidis/MAGD-150/blob/gh-pages/f18magd150lab05_Weber.zip)
  This lab challenged us to create a project that is a tv. This section wanted us to make buttons, and so I made 2 buttons, one a power button for the tv and the other for a sensor. 
# Lab 6(https://github.com/Zaidis/MAGD-150/blob/gh-pages/f18_magd150_lab06_Weber.zip)
  This lab challenged us to create a project that makes objects move by themselves, as if they have an AI. The project was meant to a screen saver, and so I made a screensaver that makes 3 shapes move around the screen.
