# Lab 5
  This lab challenged us to create a project that is a tv. This section wanted us to make buttons, and so I made 2 buttons, one a power button for the tv and the other for a sensor. 
# Lab 6
  This lab challenged us to create a project that makes objects move by themselves, as if they have an AI. The project was meant to a screen saver, and so I made a screensaver that makes 3 shapes move around the screen.
